## Project Structure

### Project Root

At the root of your project, you'll find configuration files, such as `package.json` and `README.md`.

### Source Code Directory

Your application's source code is organized in a directory named "src" or "app." This is where the core logic of your application resides.

### Entry Point File

The starting point of your application is typically an entry point file named "index.js" or "app.js." It's where your application begins its execution.

### Route Handlers and Controllers

For web applications, route handlers and controllers are often organized separately. Route handlers manage routing and HTTP request/response logic, while controllers handle the business logic. Here's an example directory structure:

```
    src/
    ├── routes/
    │ ├── userRoutes.js
    │ ├── productRoutes.js
    ├── controllers/
    │ ├── userController.js
    │ ├── productController.js
```


### Middleware

Middleware functions, used for tasks like authentication, logging, and error handling, can be organized in a dedicated "middleware" directory:

```
src/
├── middleware/
│ ├── authentication.js
│ ├── logger.js
│ ├── errorHandling.js

```


### Models and Database

If your application interacts with a database, you typically have a directory for database models. Here's an example for a MongoDB project using Mongoose:

```
src/
├── models/
│ ├── User.js
│ ├── Product.js
```

### Views (For Web Apps)

For web applications with server-side rendering, you might have a "views" directory:

```
src/
├── views/
│ ├── index.ejs
│ ├── about.ejs
│ ├── error.ejs
```

### Public Assets (For Web Apps)

Static assets like CSS, JavaScript, and images are often placed in a "public" directory:

```
public/
├── css/
│ ├── style.css
├── js/
│ ├── script.js
├── img/
│ ├── logo.png
```

### Tests

Unit and integration tests can be organized in a "tests" directory:

```
tests/
├── unit/
│ ├── user.test.js
│ ├── product.test.js
├── integration/
│ ├── api.test.js
```

### Configuration and Environment Variables

Configuration files and environment variable management can be organized in a "config" directory:

```
config/
├── config.js
├── database.js
```

### Dependencies

The "node_modules" directory contains project dependencies installed via npm or yarn. You don't typically manage this directory manually; it's generated by your package manager.

### Other Files and Directories

You may have additional directories for utilities, scripts, or any other project-specific needs.
